Hello! Welcome to my personal page. My name is Pedro Baptista de Castro, and I`m currently (as of time of writing) \\
a second year PhD student at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) / University of Tsukuba in Tsukuba, Japan.

My current work involves in optimizing/searching magnetocaloric materials for possible use in solid-state hydrogen liquefaction systems.\\
To achieve this, I mostly work with using data-driven models (constructed on experimental data), together with "traditional" methods (ie. chemical substituion)
to optimize and search for such materials. I use a lot of python to automatize my analysis (to quickly deal with characterization data, mostly magnetization). 
Now I am currently focusing in solving one the bottlenecks (that I actually encountered) in data driven candidate search: Automatic identification of phases in XRD patterns.

Here, you might find (in the future, possibly), posts about how I handle this issue. I am planning to write a series of
posts about using python for automating characterization data analysis, and how I solved (or tried to) the issue automatic/semi-automatic
XRD analysis without deep learning.
